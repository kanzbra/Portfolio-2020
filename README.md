# Portfolio-2020

It has been over a year since I graduated as Full Stack Web Developer from Columbia's 'Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science' Bootcamp and since then I have further developed my skills through self learning.
I wanted my portfolio to reflect the progress I have made as a web dev.

A few months after I graduated from the bootcamp, I explored the world of entrepreneurship by freelancing as a web developer. It was a crazy start but now I have recruited my fifth client.

The journey of learning how to code never stopped and it has been an extremely thrilling to explore new frameworks and languages and I can't wait to see what's next.
